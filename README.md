# barcode-scanner
A tool made as a practice for my GCSE NEA

It allows you to input a barcode to check that it is valid, restock an item or purchase an item. 
It is a more basic version of the system I later created for my A-Level NEA, called BabyyPOS. 

To run this program, open and run the .py file in the main directory
